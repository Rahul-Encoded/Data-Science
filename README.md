# Solar Energy Potential Prediction Project:
    # ML Models used: Dummy Regressor(used as a baseline model for comparison), Random Forest Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Multi-layer Perceptron Regression.
    # Implemented feature selection techniques like RFECV to optimize predictive accuracy. 
    # Best model (Random Forest Regressor) achieved an R2 score of 0.668, slightly outperforming previous benchmark studies on the same dataset.
# Hotel Booking Prediction System:
    # ML Models used: Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, RandomForest, DecisionTree.
    # Best model (Random Forest) achieved an accuracy score of 0.956.
